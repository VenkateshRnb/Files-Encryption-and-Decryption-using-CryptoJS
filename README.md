# Files-Encryption-and-Decryption-using-CryptoJS

#### Initial Note:
  I always had an idea to develop an application that encrypts files such as documents, images, videos etc., for privacy. This idea led me to develop this web application. I surfed through many online resources to make this idea come true. Then I came to know about the CryptoJS libraries in JavaScript that helps to encrypt the files.

#### What can it do?
- This is basically a web app that is used to encrypt and decrypt the files locally.
- Pass code is used to encrypt the files( User-defined ).
- The same pass code is used to decrypt the files that are encrypted using this tool.

#### This application is still in the initial phase of development.
#### HTML and CSS are used to develop the front-end of the web application.
#### CryptoJS libraries (https://code.google.com/archive/p/crypto-js/) are used to encrypt and decrypt the files.
